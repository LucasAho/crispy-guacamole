# Repo Discription
This repo holds Friend Finder, a homework assignment with my bootcamp that utilizes Node and Express servers to build an API and program that links similar personalities found in a personality survey. A user will need to fill out a survey about themselves, which is sent into the server and compared to other surveys until a closest match is found.


## Purpose and Function
This app servers as a rudimentary version of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, pairing users with similar qualities in order to find them a "friend". To use the app, a user needs only to visit the main website, take the survey, and wait for a pop-up modal displaying their best match. To host your own version of the website, a user must install all node dependencies, and set up server.js with node to run while others use the site. For the purposes of delivering this homework, I have deployed the website to Heroku.
